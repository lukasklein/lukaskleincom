I'm Lukas, a developer and student based in Munster, Germany.

Work Experience
---------------

Product Gang - Berlin, Germany
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2012 - current — Developer & Co-Founder

Co-Founded the `Product Gang`_ to turn visionaries' great ideas into even
better crafted and implemented products that are ready to go live or to pitch
to investors. I focus on everything related to the actual development and
server setup / administration.

Some of the projects we've done:

**boilerroom.tv**

We've managed their infrastructure as well as maintained their website. Some of
the sub-projects include building a realtime chat system based on Firebase and
social stream aggregators for special events. We are also responsible for their
mobile apps (iOS and Android), of which the iOS one was featured worldwide in
the Apple AppStore.

**Media Management System**

In compliance with Boiler Room's special needs, we have built a custom media
management and -publishing system that allows them to transcode, serve and
publish audio and video files. For the server infrastructure we incorporated
Docker, Packer, Redis, RabbitMQ and the DigitalOcean API to create an
auto-scaling system that scales with the files being transcoded.

**Radio stations**

We have built host dashboards for multiple German radio stations as well as
a web- and mobile radio player for one of Germany's biggest radio stations.

**Splash!Mag Moment of Truth**

For the second year in a row we have built the voting system for Splash!Mag's
Moment of Truth competition using Django.

**Publishing network**

We're responsible for the infrastructure of Germany's largest financial
publishing network. In addition to maintaining existing software and servers,
we are also building several microservices based on Python / Django and Docker.

Datasift - Reading, United Kingdom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2012 — Intern

During my time at DataSift one of the projects I have developed was a tool to track and analyse the impact of popular influencers on the sharing velocity of news articles in social media. I used the opportunity to dive deeper into realtime technologies such as Node.js, Redis, websockets and frontend visualisations using D3.js.
